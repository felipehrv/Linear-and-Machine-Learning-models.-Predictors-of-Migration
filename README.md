Purpose: run Linear and Machine Learning models on the predictors of migration.

We use different datasets from the Worl Bank and the Migration Policy Institute. We use variables that measure economic performance, inequality, life expectancy, popultion, remittances and aid. We analyze only the three countries of Central America; El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras. These countries have the higher levels of emigration to the U.S. after Mexico in Latin America.

World bank data: governance, trade, labor conditions, economic performance, education and life expectancy.
